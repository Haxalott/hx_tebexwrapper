# hx_tebexwrapper
Tebex wrapper script for FiveM.

# Usage
Pretty self explanitory.
When a player purchases a package on your tebex page, configure it like this.
<img width="2160" height="396" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65d87293-22a4-4059-b912-62a3cee25b55" />
> Field 1 is the name of the package in the config, for example I have custom plate, so it says ['customplate'] = {} in the config
> Field 2 is the transaction id, eg. tbx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, which is the variable {transaction} in tebex.
Then just add what you want to trigger when a player claims the package they ordered in game in the config.
